          I’m Luke, a Software Engineer with a background in Manufacturing and
          Electrical Engineering, and an obsession with learning new skills and
          technologies. After losing my job during the pandemic, I started
          teaching myself C++, and I discovered a hidden talent and love for
          coding. I’m looking for opportunities to grow my knowledge and
          experience in Software Engineering, and to create highly efficient
          applications, without sacrificing user experience.
