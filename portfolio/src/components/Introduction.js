        <p>
          I’m a Software Engineer with a background in Manufacturing and
          Electrical Engineering, and an obsession with learning new skills and
          technologies. During the pandemic I started teaching myself C++, and I
          discovered a hidden talent and love for coding. I’m looking for
          opportunities to grow my knowledge and experience in Software
          Engineering, and to create highly efficient applications, without
          sacrificing user experience.
